  # Chromatic
  *Chromatic is a completely standalone browser with absolutely no frameworks 
  or external packages, just* **raw code**.

  Inspired by *Web Browser Engineering* by Pavel Panchekha and Chris Harrelson, 
  Chromatic was designed for my own personal curiosity of web 
  browsers while studying the Chromium source code.
  Chromatic handles industry standards of all browsers, such as rendering, 
  layout, and network handling in pure Python. It's a minimal, yet functional 
  web browser; ideal for educational purposes and low-level systems exploration.
