  # Chromatic
  A fully standalone web browser with **no external libraries**.

  Inspired by *Web Browser Engineering* by Pavel Panchekha and Chis Harrelson, 
  Chromatic was designed for my own personal intellectural curiosity of web 
  browsers while studying the Chomium source code.
  Chromatic handles industry standards of all browsers, such as rendering, 
  layout, and network handling in pure Python. It's a minimal, yet functional 
  web browser; ideal for educational purposes and low-level systems exploration.

  *Chromatic is a completely standalone browser with absolutely no frameworks 
  or external packages, just* **raw code**.
